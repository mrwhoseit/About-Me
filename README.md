## EPIC Experience

### Pi's and Python
A lot happened in the 18 weeks that this semester course had to offer. We started small and learned how to use a Linux terminal, then we worked our way up to learning the essentials of the Python programming language. The first half of the course consisted of learning the main topic of the class which of course is Python, to then proving our skills with the language by doing some popular options for assignments. Harvard’s CS50 course is a good example. It taught us how to use different abilities Python had to offer. Overall the programs and courses that we took this semester were great and helpful, but the root of the skills we grew from was the collaboration and assistance we got from students and teachers.

### Workforce Readiness
- I welcome feedback from others and contribute to other's growth by giving feedback in appropriate ways. 
- I develop multiple strategies to address an identified issue or problem.
- I make ethical decisions that are respectful of others.
- I model a positive attitude that respects others.
- I am prepared for class each day: on time, materials, appearance.
### Professional Experiences
- Work Site tours
- Job shadowing
- Conferences
- Professional Organizations

## Projects: 
-  Morse Code - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mrwhoseit/morse_code)
	- The project was simple, you use a button and a buzzer to work together and create Morse code with your Python program. The program used a Morse Code dictionary to run the script, and RPi.GPIO (General Input Output) for the drivers to make it all function accordingly.
	- The project required some trial and error since some components we used in class didn’t function correctly or used proprietary modules from Python. I personally used some communication with my peers to help enhance or fix any errors in the program.
